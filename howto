Quick lowdown on everything:

Prefixing lines with # means execute these as root (via sudo, sudo -i, su,
etc.), and $ means execute as user.

ALSA is a thing that makes sound actually happen.  This is also known as a
sound backend.

PulseAudio is similar, but usually gets in the way for the setup we're going to
go over.  I've disabled it completely, either by uninstalling it or disabling
it at startup.

Jack is a way for you to output audio from one program to input it into
another.  It's really nifty once you get the hang of it, and really frustrating
when you realize programs that should record sound don't recourd it via jack
(audacity, obs-studio on ubuntu).

Please note that there are many ways to set up this stuff.  This is my personal
setup documented strictly for me and hopefully anyone who may find this useful.
I can't guarantee that the steps will work for you.

First, disable pulseaudio.  This is the safest way I've figured to go about
things:

	# echo "manual" > /etc/init/pulseaudio.override
	# pulseaudio --kill
	# apt-get autoremove pulseaudio # OPTIONAL

The first line makes pulseadudio only available by starting it manually.  The
third line is optional, and might break things for a while.

So, now we need jack.  I also use qjackctl because it's easy mode.
jack-capture for actually recording, and sometimes I use jack-mixer to mess
around with volume.

	# apt-get install jackd qjackctl jack-capture jack-mixer

So, alsa loopback's a thing.  Basically, when you use jack, especially as
realtime priority, if you don't have another device to output to, you can't
actually get sound output from most applications, because they use alsa.  The
fix for this is found at:

I was able to just copy and paste the first file and make it work.  Your
mileage may very, yes.
