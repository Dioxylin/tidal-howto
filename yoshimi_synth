So, when I open up Yoshimi, I don't have any audio engineering experience.  I'm
pretty much at a complete loss of what in the world makes a tone from an
instrument sound like it does, and what makes a sine wave sound so boring.  So,
I wanted to learn, and I can't find decent tutorials on it, but I want to get
started now, dammit!

So I took the general concepts of Learn Code the Hard Way
(http://learncodethehardway.org/) in order to figure out audio synthesis.  As
an aside, this also demonstrates the usefulness of how Learn Code the Hard Way
basically applies to much more than coding.

So, basically what I did to understand at least a little of what was going on
with the synthesizer settings was:

Find a simple synthesizer that only uses one synth (I used Bass 1 which only
has ADDsynth).  Use it for one of the channels and put both left and right to
one speaker.  My setup has a jack_mixer that was just passthrough to System,
which I found easier to have so I could also connect it to japa to visualize
the sound.

Go to the menu Yoshimi and click "New Instance" (mine was named Yoshimi-1).

Set up the new instance by selecting "Simple sound" and put that to the other speaker.

Then I opened the synth that the bass had (ADDsynth) and the synth the simple
sound had and started copying over the settings by hand and listening to how it
would transform the sound.  After I found an interesting control to change the
sound, I played around with it to see what sort of effects I could get with it.

I continued until I got pretty much close enough with the bass sounds and could
verify that they were similar visually.

It won't teach me everything about making sounds, and I don't expect to be a
wizard at any length, but people who start doing sound synthesis also probably
didn't.
